                In 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them.[21] Tsuji noted
                the profits gained by adding a cute design to the shoes and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his
                merchandise.[21] Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in
                1974.

                pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl.She first appeared in the United States in
                1976 when Sanrio opened a Gift Gate store in San Jose, California</p>

                The oldest of Hawaiian chants describe the Hawaiian Islands, the spirits that inhabit them, the forces of nature that
                shaped them and all the living things upon them as inextricably connected. This sense of connection is the foundation of
                Hawaiian culture: understanding that we all have a mandate to mālama, to care for our environment and for one another.

                <p class="wd-content-details-1">Today, Hawaiian culture may hold many of the answers sought in a rapidly changing world. The spirit of aloha – being in
                the presence of and sharing the essence of life – teaches us lessons of peace, kindness, compassion and responsibility
                to future generations. These lessons are expressed through chant, music, hula, arts and cultural practices, and through
                the warm, genuine greetings that are a hallmark of Hawaiian hospitality.</p>
